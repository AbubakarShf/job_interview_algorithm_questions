# Determine if two Binary Search Trees are identical.

Write a method called `areIdentical`. This method takes two root nodes and returns a boolean that represents whether the two Binary Search Trees are identical.


  Notes:

      Two trees are identical when they have same data and the arrangement of data is also same.

      It is not necessary that trees having same data are identical trees. Trees having exact same data may not be structurally        identical.


Example:

  ![Binary Search Tree -areIdentical](../_images/identical-binary-trees.png)

For the tree above:

  ```js
  areIdentical(rootOne,rootTwo);
  //True
  ```



  ![Binary Search Tree -areIdentical](../_images/not-identical-bst.png)

  For the tree above:

```js
areIdentical(rootOne,rootTwo);
//False
```
